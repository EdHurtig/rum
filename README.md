# Rum

Like `rm` but it will randomly delete an additional file for you

![Rum makes you do funny things](http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/pirates/images/e/ec/Rum-gone.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20130326103436)

# Usage

Type your normal `rm` command

```
My-Server:/usr/lib root# rum -rf ~/Documents/myproject
```

but then realize that you actually typed `rum` instead of `rm`
Rum will delete a random file from your current working directory too (/usr/lib)
just like it will erase your memory of last night

In case it wasn't clear, this tool is not meant to actually be used. It is a
joke.
